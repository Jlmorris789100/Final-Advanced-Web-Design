	<h2> Hi, I'm Joe Butler!</h2>
	<p class="bio">I am a freelance plumbing serving the Chester County, PA area. I live in Parkesburg, PA with my wife and three kids. Not only do I have a large family, I also have a lot of pets! I have five birds, and four dogs. I am very down to Earth and believe that in order to be a good plumber, I need to know what I’m doing, show up on time, be kind, offer reasonable prices, and get the job done. I will show up offering all those things, but I will warn you ... I show up ready to work and get a little dirt on me, so don’t expect me to be in a suit!</p>

	<div class="centered"> <h2 class="Experience"> Experience</h2> I grew up being a hands-on kind of guy and was always tinkering with projects. If something was wrong in any of my relatives houses, I was the one they called. I love being someone that can help others, so building a freelance business has always been a goal of mine. I first got into plumbing when my family decided our bathroom needed a makeover. I knew how the piping worked due to always fixing things years before, and learned as I went. <br><br><br>From there I did mounds of research to find the best apporaches to take and how to fix specific plumbing needs.I started working for a small flooring business, and learned how to work with bathroom and 
	kitchen piping due to laying the floors around it or pulling prexisting floors out to see the plumbing work beneath. I learned how to conduct business, communicate with customers, and complete hands-on tasks from laying flooring, reworking pipes, redoing the layout of a bathroom or kicthen, etc.</div>
